# Memoirs of a Dread Pirate
This was my Junior Seminar project for undergrad - I worked with a team of 6 people to build this from the ground up, using assets either created by us or creative commons assets downloaded from the web.

I forked the old repository and intend to rebuild it to be more interesting as a game.
